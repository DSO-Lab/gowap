# Gowap [[Wappalyzer](https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer) implementation in Go]

* Current implementation does not support analyzing JS variables, cause I could not find
easy way to get global js variables from Window object in GO, anyone welcome to contribute!

* Some features was not implemented, such as confidence rate, as I do not see need for it. I also did not implement recursive crawling, but it is pretty easy to do.
* If you want to participate in development, fork it, make your advancements and create merge request, everyone is welcome!
